Senior Data & Cloud Engineer | AWS Data Platforms, Distributed Systems, Analytics at Scale | Helping Organizations Build Reliable, Cost-Efficient Data Infrastructure
<br></br>
<h3>About Me</h3>

I am a senior Data and Cloud Engineer with extensive experience designing, building, and operating scalable data platforms on AWS. I specialize in transforming complex business requirements into reliable, secure, and high-performing data systems that support analytics, reporting, and data-driven decision-making.
<br></br>
My background includes architecting and implementing end-to-end data pipelines using AWS services such as S3, Glue, Lambda, Step Functions, EMR, and Airflow, alongside modern analytics platforms including Databricks and Snowflake. I have deep experience working with SQL, distributed data processing, and large-scale datasets in production environments.
<br></br>
Beyond hands-on development, I bring an architectural and operational mindset—focusing on data quality, observability, cost optimization, and system reliability. I have led initiatives to modernize legacy data workflows, improve pipeline performance, and establish best practices for documentation, automation, and governance.
<br></br>
I am known for collaborating effectively across engineering, analytics, and business teams, mentoring engineers, and delivering solutions that balance speed, scalability, and long-term maintainability. My work is driven by a practical focus on impact: building data platforms that teams can trust and grow with as their needs evolve.
