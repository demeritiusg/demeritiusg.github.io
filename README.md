## About Me

I am a senior Data and Cloud Engineer with extensive experience designing, building, and operating scalable data platforms on AWS. I specialize in translating complex business requirements into reliable, secure, and high-performing data systems that support analytics, reporting, and data-driven decision-making.

My background includes architecting and implementing end-to-end data pipelines using AWS services such as S3, Glue, Lambda, Step Functions, EMR, and Airflow, alongside modern analytics platforms including Databricks and Snowflake. I have deep experience working with SQL, distributed data processing, and large-scale datasets in production environments.

Beyond hands-on development, I bring an architectural and operational mindset—focusing on data quality, observability, cost optimization, and system reliability. I have led initiatives to modernize legacy data workflows, improve pipeline performance, and establish best practices for automation, documentation, and governance.

I collaborate closely with engineering, analytics, and business teams, and I enjoy mentoring engineers and helping teams build data platforms they can trust and scale as their needs evolve.
